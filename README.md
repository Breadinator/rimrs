# RimRs
NOTE: does literally nothing now lmao, and won't until 0.1.0 for even basic functionality.

A 3rd party mod manager for RimWorld based on RimPy. Made because (1) RimPy is closed source and (2) RimPy is pretty slow.

# Roadmap
Not sure if this is the actual order, but this is what I intend on doing.

[ ] 0.1.0: Basic mod ordering
[ ] 0.2.0: Basic mod sorting and show basic mod metadata
[ ] 0.3.0: Settings independent of RimPy (but still use RimPy config if none detected?)
[ ] 1.0.0: Windows build release

## Other planned features
Features that I plan on adding but don't remotely know when.

[ ] Sorting based on Fluffy's Mod Manager files
[ ] Sorting based on RimPy's community rules
